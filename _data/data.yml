    intro: >
      Throughout the development process, I utilized a combination of ASP .NET Core, Angular, Entity Framework Core, MS SQL, Docker, 
      XUnit, ASP .NET Core Identity, and GitHub Actions. These technologies and tools provided me with a powerful toolkit to build 
      dynamic web applications with efficient backend systems and seamless user interfaces. 
      
      The projects were successfully deployed using the Heroku service. This cloud platform provided a reliable and scalable environment 
      for hosting the applications, allowing them to be accessible to users across the globe.
